# MLOps using Terraform in AWS
This project includes the codes and configurations to build a MLOps pipeline in AWS with Terraform. The machine learning model is built to predict customer churn and deployed with Flask API and Docker using AWS services. 

This is the blog where I explained the building process : https://medium.com/@farsim/machine-learning-deployment-in-docker-and-mlops-in-aws-using-terraform-6d526552f33f
